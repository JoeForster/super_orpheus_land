# Super Orpheus Land

WIP - working title!

This is a very unfinished platformer game project for the Ubisoft Reflections and Leamington Autumn Jam 2023

Basic premise: you're Orpheus, and you're heading into the Underworld to retrieve your dead wife Eurydice. You're not much of a fighter, but you're good at playing soothing music with the Lyre. See how far you can get...
